HORMONE-BASED PREDICTIONS REPORT - PATIENT SPLIT
=================================================

DATA SPLIT INFORMATION:
- Total patients: 42
- Training patients: 33 (80%)
- Testing patients: 9 (20%)
- Training samples: 4,424
- Testing samples: 1,235

DATASET OVERVIEW:
- Total samples: 5,659
- Features used: 48
- Hormone features: ['lh', 'estrogen', 'pdg']

MODEL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
- phase: Train Accuracy = 0.952, Test Accuracy = 0.500
- menstruation_start: Train R = 0.977, Test R = 0.940
- glucose: Train R = 1.000, Test R = -0.062

KEY ADVANTAGES OF PATIENT SPLIT:
1. No data leakage between training and testing
2. Models evaluated on completely unseen patients
3. More realistic performance estimation
4. Prevents overfitting to specific patient patterns
5. Better generalization to new patients

PATIENT SPLIT VALIDATION:
- Training and test sets contain completely different patients
- No patient appears in both training and testing
- This prevents model from memorizing individual patient patterns
