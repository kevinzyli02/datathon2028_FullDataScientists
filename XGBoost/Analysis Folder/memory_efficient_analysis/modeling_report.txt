MEMORY-EFFICIENT MODELING RESULTS
==================================

Best Model: Top_5_Features
Average Test R²: 0.224
Number of Features: 5

Top Features:
  - lightly
  - stress_score
  - study_interval
  - very
  - moderately

Individual Target Performance:
  - lh: Train R² = 0.111, Test R² = 0.111
  - estrogen: Train R² = 0.217, Test R² = 0.218
  - pdg: Train R² = 0.344, Test R² = 0.344

Recommendations:
- Use the top 5 features for your final model
- Focus on features with highest correlation to targets
- Consider collecting more data for lower-performing targets
